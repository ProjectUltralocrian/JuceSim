# JuceSim
This is a toy project, simulating the basic structure of a digital audio workstation (DAW) and an audio processor plugin, with the emphasis on the latter. 
The structure is mainly based on the JUCE Framework, and it provides a greatly simplified simulation of how audio is processed. 
As this is a simulation, it does not actually process audio, and all the components are far simpler than the actual implementation of a JUCE plugin (let alone a functional DAW), however the aim is to write a somewhat realistic or mock implementation of some of the key features and interfaces provided by the JUCE Framework's AudioProcessor class.
The other aim is to practice and demonstrate some relatively advanced C++ features and idioms (including C++20/23 features), as well as specific design patterns that are suitable and efficient in such a context.
I might use this practice project to add new "features" in future expansions, also with the purpose of practicing relevant programming techniques.
